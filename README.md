# Malwar

**12% of ClawHub skills are malicious.** A [Snyk security audit](https://snyk.io/articles/skill-md-shell-access/) found 341 trojanized skills delivering the AMOS infostealer to 300,000 users — and that was just the first wave. By February, [824+ malicious skills](https://www.termdock.com/en/blog/clawhub-malicious-skills-incident) were live across 10,700+ listings. VirusTotal missed all of them. Code scanners missed all of them. Malwar catches them.

```bash
pip install malwar
malwar db init
malwar scan SKILL.md
```

## Why This Exists

I was installing Claude Code skills from ClawHub without a second thought — until the [ClawHavoc campaign](docs/guide/threat-campaigns.md) dropped. Hundreds of skills were trojanized with the AMOS infostealer, targeting wallet keys, SSH credentials, and agent memory files. The attacks weren't binaries or exploit code. They were natural language instructions hidden in Markdown, telling the AI to run `curl | bash` as a "prerequisite." No existing security tool is built to catch that. So I built one.

## How It Works

```
SKILL.md → Rule Engine → URL Crawler → LLM Analyzer → Threat Intel → Verdict
             <50ms         1-5s          2-10s           <100ms
```

| Layer | What it catches |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Rule Engine** | Obfuscated commands, prompt injection, credential exposure, exfiltration patterns ([26 rules](docs/guide/detection-rules.md)) |
| **URL Crawler** | Malicious URLs, domain reputation, redirect chains to C2 infrastructure |
| **LLM Analyzer** | Social engineering, hidden intent, context-dependent attacks invisible to regex |
| **Threat Intel** | Known IOCs, [campaign attribution](docs/guide/threat-campaigns.md), threat actor fingerprints |

Full pipeline details: **[Architecture](docs/development/architecture.md)**

## Quick Start

```bash
malwar scan SKILL.md                    # scan a file
malwar scan skills/                     # scan a directory
malwar scan SKILL.md --format sarif     # CI/CD output
malwar scan SKILL.md --no-llm          # skip LLM (fast + free)
malwar crawl scan beszel-check          # scan a ClawHub skill by slug
malwar crawl url https://example.com/SKILL.md  # scan any remote SKILL.md
```

```
$ malwar scan suspicious-skill.md

  MALICIOUS  Risk: 95/100  Findings: 4

  MALWAR-OBF-001   Base64-encoded command execution        critical   L14
  MALWAR-CMD-001   Remote script piped to shell            critical   L22
  MALWAR-EXFIL-001 Agent memory/identity file access       critical   L31
  MALWAR-MAL-001   ClawHavoc campaign indicator            critical   L14

  Scan completed in 42ms (rule_engine, threat_intel)
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ap6pack/malwar.git && cd malwar
pip install -e ".[dev]"
malwar db init
```

Full command reference: **[CLI Guide](docs/guide/cli-reference.md)**

## API

```bash
malwar serve    # http://localhost:8000
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "...", "file_name": "SKILL.md"}'
```

30+ endpoints covering scan submission, results, SARIF export, signatures CRUD, campaigns, reports, dashboard analytics, audit logs, and RBAC. Auth via `X-API-Key` header.

Full endpoint reference: **[API Docs](docs/guide/api-reference.md)**

## Web Dashboard

Built-in browser UI at `http://localhost:8000` when running the API server.

React 19 &middot; TypeScript &middot; Vite &middot; Tailwind CSS 4 &middot; Recharts

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d    # API + Dashboard at http://localhost:8000
```

Multi-stage build: Node.js compiles the frontend, Python 3.13-slim runs the backend.

## Configuration

All settings via environment variables with `MALWAR_` prefix or `.env` file. Key settings:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MALWAR_API_KEYS` | *(empty)* | API keys (empty = auth disabled) |
| `MALWAR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | Anthropic key for LLM layer |
| `MALWAR_DB_PATH` | `malwar.db` | SQLite database path |

## Development

```bash
pytest                                # 1,504 tests
ruff check src/ tests/                # lint
mypy src/                             # type check
```

37 test fixtures: 5 benign, 10 malicious (synthetic), 22 real-world samples from ClawHub and Snyk research.
